## ‚≠ê Principles We Aim For

- **Clarity**: Code and documentation should be clear and easy to follow.
- **Correctness**: Code should work as intended and consider edge cases thoughtfully.
- **Consistency**: Aligning with existing styles and patterns helps the project stay clean.
- **Minimalism**: Prefer simpler solutions that are easier to maintain.
- **Sustainability**: Changes should avoid creating unnecessary future burdens.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Watch For

- Adding unnecessary complexity without clear benefits.
- Forgetting about important edge cases or the user experience.
- Submitting exceptionally large pull requests without clear logical separations.
- (Optional) Using vague commit messages that could confuse later.

## ‚ùì Important Philosophy: No Assumptions

- If something feels unclear, **ask or clarify** rather than assuming.
- Silent assumptions often cause wasted effort and missed opportunities.
- Asking early saves everyone's time and strengthens the project.
