# ðŸ“Š Measuring Review Quality Improvements

## Why Measure?

Measuring helps us understand if our review guidelines are actually improving the review process. Without measurement, we're operating on assumptions rather than evidence.

## Simple Metrics to Track

### Quantitative Metrics

Track these metrics before and after implementing Aligna:

1. **Time to Resolution**
   - Average time from PR/submission to approval
   - Reduction indicates more efficient reviews

2. **Review Iteration Count**
   - Average number of review cycles before approval
   - Fewer iterations suggest clearer initial communication

3. **Comment Volume Ratio**
   - Ratio of clarifying questions to actionable feedback
   - Lower ratio indicates clearer understanding

### Qualitative Metrics

Periodically survey team members (scale 1-5):

1. **Satisfaction Score**
   - "How satisfied are you with the review process?"
   - Higher scores indicate improvement

2. **Clarity Rating**
   - "How clear was the feedback you received?"
   - Measures communication effectiveness

3. **Implementation Confidence**
   - "How confident were you in implementing requested changes?"
   - Measures actionability of feedback

## Lightweight Implementation

To keep measurement minimal:

1. Record baseline metrics before Aligna adoption
2. Re-measure after 1-3 months of consistent usage
3. Compare and adjust guidelines based on findings

Remember: The goal isn't perfect measurement, but enough data to guide improvements.

**Note**: This framework intentionally avoids heavy process. Teams should adapt these metrics to their specific context and needs.
