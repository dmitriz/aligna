# ðŸ“Š Aligna AI: Measuring Review Quality Improvements for AI Agents

## Why Measure?

Measuring helps us understand if our review guidelines are actually improving the review process when implemented by AI agents. Without measurement, we're operating on assumptions rather than evidence.

## Metrics to Track for AI Reviews

### Quantitative Metrics

Track these metrics before and after implementing Aligna in your AI review system:

1. **Resolution Efficiency**
   - Average processing steps from submission to approval (measured in steps)
   - Reduction indicates more efficient review protocols

2. **Iteration Reduction**
   - Average number of review cycles before acceptance (measured in cycles)
   - Fewer iterations suggest clearer initial feedback generation

3. **Feedback Quality Ratio**
   - Ratio of clarifying questions to actionable feedback (measured as a percentage)
   - Lower ratio indicates more precise understanding by AI agents

4. **False Positive/Negative Rates**
   - Frequency of incorrectly flagged issues or missed problems (measured as a percentage)
   - Measures accuracy of AI review processes

### Qualitative Metrics

Periodically evaluate through automated scoring:

1. **Feedback Clarity Score**
   - How clearly the AI agent expressed its reasoning (scored on a scale of 1â€“5)
   - Measures communication effectiveness

2. **Actionability Rating**
   - How directly implementable the feedback was (scored on a scale of 1â€“5)
   - Measures practical utility of AI reviews

3. **Consistency Index**
   - How consistently the AI applies standards across different submissions (scored on a scale of 1â€“5)
   - Measures reliability of the review process

## Implementation Approach

To implement effective measurement:

1. Record baseline metrics before Aligna adoption
2. Continuously monitor metrics during implementation
3. Apply automated feedback loops to improve AI review quality

For tooling, consider using telemetry scripts or dashboards like Prometheus/Grafana to facilitate baseline recording and continuous monitoring.

Remember: The goal isn't perfect measurement, but sufficient data to guide improvements in AI review capabilities.
