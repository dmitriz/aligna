- Psychological safety assessment results
- Trust calibration accuracy rates
- Feedback iteration reduction percentages

### Qualitative Indicators  
- User satisfaction with AI reviewer communication
- Perceived empathy and understanding in AI feedback
- Collaborative effectiveness ratings
- Long-term relationship quality with AI reviewers

## Cross-Project Coordination

### Complementary Usage Pattern
```
User Need: "Improve AI Review System"
├── Technical Safety → Guardrails-info
├── Instruction Design → AI-instructions  
└── Communication Excellence → Aligna
```

### Integration Guidelines
- **Guardrails provides**: Technical safety and security frameworks
- **AI-instructions provides**: How to structure and design instructions
- **Aligna provides**: How AI should communicate and collaborate with humans

### Boundary Definitions
- **Technical Implementation**: Guardrails domain
- **Instruction Architecture**: AI-instructions domain  
- **Human Communication**: Aligna domain

## Conclusion

Aligna has the opportunity to become the definitive framework for human-AI collaborative communication excellence. By focusing on the human-centered aspects of AI review systems, Aligna can fill a critical gap in the current landscape while avoiding competition with the more technically-focused Guardrails and AI-instructions projects.

The research clearly indicates that while AI systems are becoming more capable at technical tasks, they still lack sophisticated communication and collaboration capabilities. Aligna can lead this space by developing evidence-based frameworks for AI communication excellence.

**Next Steps**: Begin immediate implementation of the content restructuring plan and framework development phases outlined above.
