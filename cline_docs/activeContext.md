# activeContext.md

## Purpose

This project, `aligna`, defines a meta-framework for AI-human collaboration with a zero-prompt philosophy. The aim is to enable AI assistants to engage meaningfully in complex software ecosystems simply by reading contextual files—without needing custom prompting per task.

The assistant is expected to navigate, reason, and act based on repository-embedded context.

## Current Focus

The current focus is to integrate `aligna` with Cline’s structured memory system by:

- Creating a `cline_docs/` scaffold that maps to `aligna`’s purpose
- Validating whether `aligna`’s existing documentation is machine-navigable without prompts
- Establishing a repeatable pattern for multi-repo project memory

## Where to Start

- Begin with the top-level `README.md`
- Follow linked files and structures
- This file (`activeContext.md`) serves as the initial task memory

## Constraints

- Do not duplicate content from `README.md` or source files
- Do not restructure existing content unless explicitly requested
- All structural extensions must be modular and non-invasive
