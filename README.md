### 🔄 How Aligna Differs From Existing Solutions

- **Unlike GitHub's CODEOWNERS**: Focuses on review quality, not just assignment
- **Beyond Conventional PR Templates**: Addresses reviewer mindset, not just submission structure
- **Compared to tools like Reviewable/Gerrit**: Emphasizes human communication over technical mechanics
- **Versus linting tools (ESLint, etc.)**: Addresses holistic review culture, not just automated checks

Current gaps we're addressing that most review systems miss:

- Psychological safety in feedback delivery
- Practical minimalism (avoiding over-engineered processes)
- Cross-domain application (works for code, docs, and research papers)
