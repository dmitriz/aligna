# üìö **Aligna AI** ‚Äî Review Guidelines for AI Agents

> **Aligna is a framework specifically designed for AI agent reviewers** to provide structured, consistent, and helpful feedback on code, documentation, and research content. It offers guidelines, checklists, and metrics to improve the quality of automated reviews while maintaining a focus on actionable feedback and effective communication.

## üìå Why This Project?

- You invest your time and energy into writing code, papers, or projects ‚Äî getting clear, helpful reviews afterward is harder than it sounds.
- Expectations aren't always obvious.
- Important feedback can be missed without a simple review guide.

---

## ‚ùì Curious?

- Use our [Review Guidelines](REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md).
- Apply the practical [Review Checklist](templates/review-checklist.md) immediately.
- Measure improvements with our [Metrics Guide](METRICS.md).
- Implement these practices via our [Usage Guide](USAGE_GUIDE.md).

## üéØ Our Goal

- Help reviewers and contributors align faster.
- Encourage high-quality, clear, productive collaboration.
- Support better outcomes with less stress and wasted time.

- Even just a quick link is appreciated!

### üîÑ How Aligna Differs From Existing Solutions

We address gaps such as:

- **Unlike GitHub's CODEOWNERS**: Focuses on review quality, not just assignment ([Learn more about CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners))
- **Beyond Conventional PR Templates**: Addresses reviewer mindset, not just submission structure ([Explore PR templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests))
- **Compared to tools like Reviewable/Gerrit**: Emphasizes human communication over technical mechanics ([Reviewable](https://reviewable.io/) | [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/))
- **Versus linting tools (ESLint, etc.)**: Addresses holistic review culture, not just automated checks ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/))

**Current gaps we're addressing that most review systems miss:**

- Psychological safety in feedback delivery
- Practical minimalism (avoiding over-engineered processes)
- Cross-domain application (works for code, docs, and research papers)
